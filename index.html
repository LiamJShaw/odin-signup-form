                This is not a cult! There's nothing cult-like goes on here. No cult members, cultists, whatever you want to call us. Them. 
                The other people. The ones in cults. Not like here. This is definitely <em>not</em> a cult. Not that we would tell you if 
                we were. We aren't, but we're just pointing out that a cult would never tell you it was a cult. People who aren't in 
                cults, like us, will obviously also say that, so it's hard to tell sometimes. Look, just, we're not a cult. Sign up below.

                You <em>know</em> you want to.  It's not like we're a cult or anything.
